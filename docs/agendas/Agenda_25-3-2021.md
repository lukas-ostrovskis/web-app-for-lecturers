Main focus: Avoiding unnecessary negative impact on our grade \
Chair: Lukas Ostrovskis \
Note taker: Martin Petrov

## Question for the TA:

* Is the work distribution only checked by commits or also by the amount of code they contain?
* If a feature hasn't been implemented fully during the sprint, should one still merge it to dev/merge to show that you've done some work during the week? Or is pushing your feature branch enough?
* Is testing the GUI necessary and if it is can you recommend a way to do it?
